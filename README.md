# OmniEdge 

**Bring intranet on the internet**

OmniEdge is an Open source p2p layer 2 VPN infrastructure based on [n2n](https://github.com/ntop/n2n) protocol, a traditional VPN alternative. No central server, easy to scale with less maintenance. What happens in intranet, stays in in intranet.

## Free public supernode

We offer public supernodes you are using for starter plans, allocated automatically by your registered IP address via GeoIP. You network may be slow if your IP location is different from your devices. But you can [use your own supernode](https://omniedge.io/docs/article/install/customize-supernode) with [pro & team plans](https://omniedge.io/pricing).
